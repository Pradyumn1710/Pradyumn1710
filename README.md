## 👋 Hi there!

### I'm Pradyumn

A **Computer Science student at IIIT Nagpur**, currently in my fourth year, specializing in **AI/ML**. While my academics focus on artificial intelligence, my true passion lies in **Web Development** and **High-Performance Computing (HPC)**. I enjoy building powerful, user-focused web apps and optimizing complex algorithms to run fast on GPUs.

### 🚀 Projects

* 🔭 **[Second Brain](https://github.com/Pradyumn1710/secondbrain)**
  Inspired by Tiago Forte’s *Building a Second Brain*, this is a **RAG-based personal knowledge system** that integrates with a ChatGPT interface. It helps users store, retrieve, and interact with their thoughts, favorites, notifications, and more — turning scattered digital inputs into a streamlined, searchable second mind.

* ⚙️ **Batched LU Decomposition on GPU**
  A high-performance **LU factorization algorithm** optimized with CUDA, supporting batched matrix processing and GPU memory-level enhancements.
